With transition, we can only do something when an external event happens (hover, click etc)

What if we want something to go on perpetually?
keyframes - what state an element will have during its animation

@keyframes name {
    0% { //0% of the time pe kya karna hai

    }

    25% { //what to do at t = 25%

    }

    50% { ...

    }

    75% {

    }
}

animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count

animation-direction -> start and finish define
                    reverse: reverse direction
                    alternate: normal reverse normal reverse...
                    alternate-reverse: starts from reverse

animation-timing-function -> ease-in, ease-in-out

animation-fill-mode -> specifies styles for element when the animation is not playing (before start, after end etc)
                    forwards: end point pe
                    backwards: start point pe
