CSS has variables that can be resued so that we don't have to remember the properties to use them later.

SYNTAX ->
:root {                 or              :html {
    --div-background-color: red;
    --text-color: black;
    --div-padding: 10px;
    --div-margin: 10px;
}                                        }

.class {
    background-color: var(--div-background-color);
}

You can override the variables for specific conditions

> You can have a fallback value for when your variable is not declared.
    (see styles.css)

> The best thing about these variables is that you can interact with them through JS
