Integrating Bootstrap in our EJS.
> First, download the compiled CSS and JS files from bootstrap's website
> Create a /css and /js directory in your public folder, move bootstrap.min.css to /css,
    bootstrap.min.js to /js

> In your ejs file, instead of styles.css, write /css/bootstrap.min.css 
                    instead of script.js, write /js/bootstrap.min.js 

> In your console, it may say that we need jQuery to run bootstrap.js 
> Go to jQuery's website, download the compiled production version, and place it in /js
> in your ejs file, <script src = /js/jquery.js>

Now you can start using Bootstrap as normal :D 


                                PARTIALS 

> Including templates in our ejs files, to reuse code.
for eg, the <!DOCTYPE html> etc 

> <%- include('partials/template_name') %>
