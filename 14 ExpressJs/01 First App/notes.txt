> We need to execute express by calling the function express() and save the return value in a variable called app.
> app.listen(port, callback) -> listens for http requests and needs a port to listen to http requests. put 3000 for now or 8080
                -> accepts a callback function and runs just when the server has started running.

> Where do we send the request to/ What URL do I send a request to?
    https://localhost:portnumber
    It's running locally on our machine only.

                                REQUESTS AND RESPONSES

> To respond with content -> request and response are objects made by express and they are automatically passed in the callback 

    app.use((req, res) => {
        
    })

> An HTTP request is not a JS object, it's text information. Express parses it and turns it into an object.
> console.dir(req) gives a massive object, with headers, URL, protocols, pathname etc.
> The response object has methods, including response.send();

    eg, res.send("This is a response!");
    eg, res.send("<h1>This is a response</h1>");

    We can respond with text/a js object (turns it into JSON)

> You can send a status code with your response, res.status(404).send('this page does not exist XP');

                                    ROUTING
> app.get('/cats', (req, res) => {})            runs when a request matching /cats comes in

> This will only match 'get' requests.

app.post() -> post requests 

> If we want to have a generic response, use app.get("*") (matches everything). Put this at the bottom of your routes as a hail mary

                                GENERIC PATTERN

> For now, we only have direct match routes i.e. they run when our request exactly matches "cats".
> For example, Reddit has hundreds of thousands of subreddits, does it have an app.get() for each subreddit?
        NO 

They use a pattern, reddit.com/r/something -> 'something' would be a variable 
> In express we use : to denote that it's a variable app.get('reddit.com/r/:subreddit')
> To use the subreddit variable, we can find it in the req.params object.
> If we chain requests, r/subreddit/postId this is completely different.
                        r/:subreddit/:postId -> postId is inside the same object. 

> This may seem useless now, but we can use this with databases to construct a web page and send it back!

                                        QUERY STRINGS 
                                        
> /search?q=coding 
> Here, q is a query string.
> The query in an incoming HTTP request is found in req.query object
