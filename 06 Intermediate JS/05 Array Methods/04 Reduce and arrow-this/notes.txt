                        REDUCE

1. Reduces an array to a single value, how it does that is upto us.
    
    [3,5,7,9, 11].reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {
        return accumulator + currentValue
    })

    //35

    -> Accumulator function

2. Specify a starting point as another argument in function.


                        ARROW FUNCTIONS AND 'THIS'

If you create an object and create a method using normal function, 'this' works normally
If you replace it with arrow functions, inside an arrow function, 'this' refers to the scope it was created in.

In arrow functions, 'this' depends on how the function is executed.

In the shoutName function, setTimeout is a method on the window object, that's why it's giving an error.

We can solve that using arrow functions. Since the arrow function was created inside a regular function,
'this' inside that arrow function will get its context from its outer scope, i.e. the person.

Basically, in most cases use a normal function to create a method.
