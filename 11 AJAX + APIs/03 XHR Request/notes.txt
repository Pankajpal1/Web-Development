Old way -> XMLHttpRequest

-> Doesn't support promises, so lots of callbacks

-> Very clunky syntax



1. Create an XMLHttpRequest object and store it in a variable

2. req.open("method(GET/POST)", "url")
3. req.send()

req.onload = function() {
    runs when successful
}

req.onerror = function() {
    runs when error
}

USE FETCH -> newer, fancier way of making requests
