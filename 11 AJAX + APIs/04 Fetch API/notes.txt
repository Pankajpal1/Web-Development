fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people/4/");

 - returns a promise
 
But the response body doesn't have our required content??

That's because our promise is resolved as soon as Fetch receives any headers.
i.e. it may not have our JSON data before it's resolved.

solution - response.json() -> It also returns a promise
