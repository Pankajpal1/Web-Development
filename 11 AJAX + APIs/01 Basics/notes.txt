We're going to learn how to make requests to a server using JavaScript.
> AJAX
    Asynchronous Javascript And Xml
    
> Refreshing, submitting a form, infinite scroll -> All of them are requests.
> Dynamic search (website that shows new results when you type in the search bar without submitting)

> Sometimes, when we make an app, we just want information back, not a full webpage.
> What the server then responds with, is not HTML CSS or JS. Info is returned as a string, which is a format called JSON.


                            APIs

Application Programming Interface

An interface where one piece of software interacts with another software.

> eg. Some websites create an endpoint for people to use, and when we use these endpoints
    they respond with data for other softwares to use (a portal to a company's data)

> We're primarily referring to WebAPIs
> We make these requests using HTTP 
> EXPLORE APIs ON YOUR OWN

> https://cryptonator.com/api/

    The reason we may want raw information, is that we don't need the styles etc

> For example, using Twitter's API, we can find out who mentioned us in a tweet, tweet without opening the app etc 


                            JSON 

> There are 2 common formats, XML (not used anymore) and JSON 

>    AJAJ but people still say AJAX (because it sounds cooler lol)

                JavaScript Object Notation

1. data is represented as key-value pairs
BUT

> Every key must be in double quotes
> undefined doesn't exist in JSON 
If you try to assign undefined to a value, it will treat it as "undefined"

To convert JSON data to Javascript object ->

    const data = JSON.parse(variable)

2. To convert an object to json -> JSON.stringify(value)

3. JSON is used with other languages as well, like Python, Ruby and they have their own methods
    of parsing through JSON files
