> Hoppscotch and Postman are free tools to test your APIs and send requests. They are pretty much the same, only difference is in UI.
> You can make requests to other apis using these tools as well!


HTTP Request Verbs (type of requests) 

> Get, Post, Put, Patch, etc 

> Almost all of the free APIs are "get" request based.
> If you try to make a post request, you'll get a 404 error.

Get requests -> get/retrieve information
Post requests -> trying to send data somewhere(database, server etc)



                        HTTPS STATUS CODES 

404, 500 etc.
> HTTP response codes when we make a response

> 2__ successful responses
> 201 - created, 202 - accepted etc 

Client error responses (for eg, asking for an endpoint that does not exist)
4__
404, 403; 405 - Method not allowed etc

5__ Server-side errors


                        HTTP QUERIES

1.We can include some information in an HTTP request
2. https://swapi.dev/api/people returns a JSON file of all the people
    https://swapi.dev/api/people/1/ would return a specific character

3. https://swapi.dev/api/people/<id> also valid syntax, given in many documentations.

4. QUERY STRING 
    etc. https://amazon.com?k=bucatini&crid=3idtufdws0da5&sprefix=bucat%2caps%2c317&ref=nb_sb_noss_2

    These consist of key-value pairs, separated by '&'
    eg ?sort=desc&color=blue

5. Unless an API is specifically looking for some query strings, it will just ignore them.

6. You don't have to type these queries yourself, you can add it in "Parameters" in Hoppscotch. You can toggle them as well.

7. Headers are basically key-value pairs that come with requests that tell us meta data -> type of data, time etc

8. Some APIs require us to specify custom headers.
