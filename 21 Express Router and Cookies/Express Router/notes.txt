                                    ROUTER
We can put all our routes in a single file, like we have been doing till now. But in a huge app, it 
gets very complicated to find routes.

Router is an in-built feature. A router is an object and a mini-application.
We may want to group similar routes together, /shelters/:id, /shelters/:id/edit, /shelters - all these could go in a "shelters" route.

How to add our own middleware?
