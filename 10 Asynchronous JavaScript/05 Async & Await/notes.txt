                                Async functions

> They help us write clean async code, nothing new
> A new coat of paint on our code

Async and Await are pretty much only used together.

> Async functions return a new Promise
async function() {
    //code
}

> If our function returns a value, our promise is resolved with that value.

> To reject a promise, 
    throw new Error("")
    or throw (string)

> AWAIT 
    Helps us to write synchronous code.
    - It will pause execution of our async function and wait for promise to be resolved

    async function rainbow() {
    delayedColorChange("red", 1000)
    delayedColorChange("orange", 1000) //it will instantly turn to orange
}

To prevent this, we use "await"
