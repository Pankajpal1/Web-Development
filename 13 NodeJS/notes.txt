                                Node.js

> It's a JavaScript runtime
> Node helps us write server-side JavaScript 

    - Until recently, we could only run JS in browsers.
    - Node helps us execute code outside of the browser

> We can't deal with DOM, user inputs, etc, but we get access to other functionalities.

Reasons to use Node.js

1. Creating Web servers and writing server-side logic
2. Used to make command line tools
3. Making Native apps (VS CODE IS A NODE APP!, Slack etc.)
4. You can make video games using Node.js 


                            The Node REPL

> This is a world of javascript, you can treat it as a console
> We don't have 'document' and 'window' here.
> We have a global scope called 'global'
    includes, setTimeout, setInterval etc

> We have built-in modules to help us interact with files, the OS etc which we don't have in the browser
> To run, type node script.js (you should be in the same directory)
            or node (type relative path to file)
