File system module is used to manage and interact with files and folders
Methods -> 
1.) fs.mkdir()
2.) fs.mkdirSync()
and many more...

By default, fs is not a thing. We need to 'require' it.
const fs = require('fs');
What is this 'sync' thing? It is the synchronous version of the function. It works just how we learnt in Async JS.
The code pauses until the function finishes running

To make files
> fs.writeFileSync(name of file, default data inside file)

> It will make the file from where you run the script in the CLI, not where the javascript file is located

boilerplate.js is a project which takes the name of a folder from us and creates a folder 
with that name, and adds 3 files in that folder.
