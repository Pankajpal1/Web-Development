In every single package we install, there is a mysterious file called package.json.
> This is very important. It contains metadata about the package/project
> description, license, version, name

> The most important is "dependencies". It has a list of all the packages, with their versions, the package further depends on.
> Some have very specific versions of their dependencies
eg exactly 1.4.0, around (~)1.4.0, greater than (^)2.5

- To create your own package.json, run npm init and follow the steps (write npm init -y to skip the questionnaire)

- Earlier, when we installed a package it gave us an warning that package.json not found
- Now that we've created our own package.json, it won't give us that warning.

** If we share our code, we only need to share the package.json file, because the user can simply install the dependencies themselves.
DO NOT PUSH THE NODE_MODULES FOLDER TO YOUR REMOTE REPO

                            INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES 

When you have the package.json file, how do you install the dependencies?
1. manually install everything -> (correct version, there could be a lot of files etc..)

2. just run npm install
