> It's a huge library of a ton of modules/packages, that other people wrote that we can use for free.

> You can use the CLI to install and use the packages.

                            INSTALLING PACKAGES 

npm install <name of package> or npm i <package>
- It will install some dependencies for the desired package in a folder called node_modules.
- Don't really touch node_modules and package-lock.json

                            INSTALLING PACKAGES GLOBALLY

- When we run npm install ..., we are installing it in the local directory, we can't use it outside
of the directory.

- To solve this, we install packages globally using -g flag
eg. npm i -g <package_name>

- If you try to use a globally installed package and it gives an error, run "npm link <package_name>"
