associating each product to a farm to this farmerShop clone

1. embedding products is a no-no, because we may want a page where we can see all
 products

2. We will have a 2-way relationship, we want to see a farm's products, and on products we want
    to see on which farm it is available.

Just adding functionality to create a farm, nothing new...

We can make a new product as we do normally, but how do we associate it to a farm? Link to add new product from a farm's page.
/farms/:farm_id/products/new
post request to /farms/:farm_id/products

How do we delete farms? Depends on what we want to happen to products. Either delete the related products or let them be.
We'll be deleting the products as well.

1) manually write the deletion code yourself
2) use mongoose middleware

findByIdAndDelete triggers a middleware called findOneAndDelete
checks farm.js and server.js
