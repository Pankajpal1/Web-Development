                        GRID SYSTEM

Helps us layout our content and create responsive websites.

1. It only works inside a container.

2. Every row in bootstrap has 12 units of space to divvy up

3. To make columns, every class starts with "col-..."

4. If you are lazy and want columns to share equal space, just write class="col"

5. img-fluid for responsive images

6. gutters are padding between elements. Remove them using "g-0"

7. align-items-start, end, center to align items vertically.
8. justify-content etc...

9. justify-conten variants also exist for different screen sizes
