                        POSITION

It determines how an element is positioned in a document. The 
top, bottom, left, & right properties determine the final position.

1. position: static;
    default
    top, right, bottom, left and z-index have no effect.

2. position: relative;
    keeps the element in the flow of the document, but we can offset it 
    relative to itself.
    we can use negative values to offset in the other direction
    It's not used a lot, you use it on a parent container to absolutely position a child element.

3. position: absolute;
    the element is removed from the flow of the document and no space is given 
    to it. Everything else in the document renders as if that element doesn't exist.

    Absolute position absolutely positions an element inside a parent container that it can reference.
    The parent it refers must have positioning != static.
    If it doesn't find a suitable parent, it will lie relative to the html element.

4. position: fixed;
    It's very similar to absolute. Fixed positioned elements lie relative to the html element.
    They stay in the same place, even if we scroll through our page (USED IN NAVBARS)


5. position: sticky;
    it starts out in its position, but if we scroll and it hits the top and then it gets fixed
