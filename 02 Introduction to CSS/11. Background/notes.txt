background-image: url() or gradient

background-size: cover -> if image is smaller than container, it will zoom into the image so that the container
                            gets covered, but some parts may get cropped out.

                contain -> fits the entire image in the container (useful if image is very big)
                auto -> keeps the original size of image and not scaled at all

                In all 3, aspect ratio is maintained

                but if we give 200px 150px, they will set width and height
                    same w/ percentages

background-repeat: repeat -> repeats image horizontally and vertically to fill the element
                    repeat-x, repeat-y -> only in specified direction
                    no-repeat -> don't repeat the image, baaki area khali rehne do
