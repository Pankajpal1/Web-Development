# How we interact with our machine using text

Why should we learn about the terminal?
REASONS ->

1. SPEED
2. For Node and Express, databases etc. They can only be operated from the terminal
3. Gives us access to everything in our computer (IMPORTANT)

TERMINAL? SHELL? COMMAND LINE? BASH? CONSOLE?
They are similar, but not exactly the same

Terminal -> A text-based interface to interact with your computer.
Shell ->    The program running on the terminal. eg, Bash, Powershell, .zsh
Bash ->     One of the most popular shells

1. ~ refers to your home directory
2. pwd (present working directory)
3. Absolute path is the complete address of a file, and you can run it from anywhere
    Relative path is ki pwd mein kahan hai 
4. You can cd ../../Pets -> go back 2 levels and go into 'Pets'
5. mkdir ABC DEF

6. 'man' command 
    It's like a help command
    But doesn't work in Bash. Use ls --help instead
7. ls -a or ls -l 
    Here, -a and -l are "flags" (think of them as arguments)

8. 'touch' creates new files
    Why is it called 'touch'?

    touch --help -> change file access and modification times
                    The official purpose of touch is to set modification and access times of files.
                    But if you call touch on a file that doesn't exist, it will create it with default permissions

9. Deleting files and folders (BE VERY CAREFUL, YOU CANNOT RESTORE THEM, THEY DON'T GO INTO RECYCLE BIN)
    rm purple.txt
    rm app.js index.html

    To remove folders -> 

    rmdir Folder (only works on empty folders)
    rm -rf Folder (use this)    
                            (recursive force)
