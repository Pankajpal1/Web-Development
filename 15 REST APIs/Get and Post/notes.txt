                                GET vs POST

Get requests are used to retrieve information/a resource.
> Get -> getting info 
    Post -> sending info
    These are just conventions, but you could reverse it, for eg. use a get request to send some data, but it's not a good idea lol.

> Get requests send data through query strings, but query strings have a cap of 2048 characters, which limits the amount of data we can send.
> Post requests send data through req.body, and we can send a javascript object, HTML, JSON etc. You can have a query string with POST
    requests as well.

                                PARSING REQUEST BODY 
req.body()
> By default, it's undefined
> You need body parsing middleware (something which runs on every request). Basically, we need to tell express what type of data to expect, JSON, html etc.
    app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
    app.use(express.JSON);
