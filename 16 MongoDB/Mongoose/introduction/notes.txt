            WHAT IS MONGOOSE??
We have an application that interacts with our database and our Node app.

Object Data Mapper (ODM) -> makes data coming from Mongo into useful JS objects.


Using Mongoose
    npm i mongoose
1. require it
2. run mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/dbName")

    But if you run your file, the terminal will kind of hang. It's not an error, it's expecting us to write some commands in the script.js
3. .connect() returns a promise, so use then-catch


                                    MODELS
1. Models are JS classes that represent data in a collection in our db
2. A model is derived from a schema. We make a model because a schema on its own is not related to mongodb, it's just JavaScript. 
    A model is what tells our db what the incoming data will be like.

A schema is just a blueprint, it does nothing. A model is a JavaScript class that represents a collection inside our DB.

Movie.insertMany() -> async function, returns a promise, with this we don't have to do .save()

UPDATING 
It doesn't return what was updated, it just returns how many were updated.

Most database operations are asynchronous, use your brain.
